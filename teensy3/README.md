# Simple Firmware for teensy 3.5 / mcp 23017 / adns 9800
## Parts list
1. [teensy 3.5](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy35.html)
2. [mcp 23017](https://www.amazon.com/MCP23017-input-output-port-expander/dp/B00I6OEWJM)
3. [adns 9800 laser sensor board](https://www.tindie.com/products/jkicklighter/adns-9800-laser-motion-sensor/)
4. diodes for each key
5. 4.7kÎ© resistors * 2
6. A pack of colored solid copper wire
    - I highly recommend using colored wire to follow the colors in the diagram. It's really nice not to have to trace wires around when you're putting it together.

## Some assumptions in this firmware
- diode cathodes (the black rings) are facing the keys
- wiring looks like this:

  Note that depending on how you wire this together, you will probably need to touchup this [mapping from matrix to layout](layout.cpp#L48-L56)
- the thumb clusters are row 5

# NOTE
I will probably be *very* slow to respond to any issues around this software, so if you need support and good documentation I would suggest picking some more popular firmware like [qmk](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
